Some explanation about TDR feature that generates C# source files:

1,  For each .xml file, TDR generates one .cs source file

2,  If .xml file contains <struct></struct> or <union></union>,
    TDR generates one .cs source file for this .xml file.

3,  All source files refered by 1 and 2 are protected by a namespace,
    with the same name as value of 'name' attribute of xml tag <metalib></metalib>.

4,  For the same release of TDR, all assistant source files(Tdr*.cs) are independent of xml files.
    That means these assistant source files can be shared by many metalibs.
    For the same reason, one project MUST contains only one set of assistant source files.
    Otherwise, linker will complains like 'symbol redefine'.

5,  In order to make the feature easy to use,
    'visualize' and 'defaultvalue' for 'wstring' are not supported.
    Otherwise, some third party library is needed.

6,  In order to reduce the difficulty , two tdr-data types -'pointer' and 'refer' are not supported.
